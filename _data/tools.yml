    - name: Claude

      type: Large Language Model
      source: Anthropic
      description: Claude is my go-to LLM. I consistently get useful content and better thinking on tough problems with Claude. I definitely vibe with Claude's tone and style, and it more consistently intuits what I'm asking for.

    - name: ChatGPT
      url: https://chat.openai.com
      type: Large Language Model
      source: OpenAI
      description: The original and most well-known LLM. Chat GPT is more multi-modal than Claude and my regualr second opionion. OpenAI adds new features to ChatGPT more quickly, but I find performance to be inconsistent. Not surprising given the size of their user base.

    - name: Gemini
      url: https://gemini.google.com
      type: Large Language Model
      source: Google
      description: Google is a technical leader in AI development and Gemini is a highly-regarded multi-modal model with impressive stats. I was unimpressed by the quality of its output from earlier versions and my occasional return visits have so far not changed my perspective.

    - name: Meta AI
      url: https://www.meta.ai/
      type: Large Language Model
      source: Meta
      description: Meta's LLM is a strong, multi-modal contender, and Yann Lecun is one of the pioneers of AI. That said, Meta is at the bottom of my Tech Trust list so I try to avoid their products whenever possible. Their recent decision to end DEI practices and abandon content moderation reenforces this decision.

    - name: Grok

      type: Large Language Model
      source: x.ai
      description: This is Elon Musk's model. Elon was an early investor in OpenAI, but his unethical behavior and authoritarian attitudes make Grok an untrustworthy non-starter. Use at your own risk.

      type: simulation
      source: Claude 3.7
      description: A 'simple' animation to help explain the basics of a four stroke internal conbustion engine. The first pass was pretty close, but through multiple iterations Claude could not see that the timing of the cycle was out of phase with the valve valves and ignition. I gave up on the 25th iteration.  PROMPT- "Can you build a visual simulation that explains the working of internal combustion engines"
