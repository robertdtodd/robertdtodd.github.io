    - name: Claude

      type: Large Language Model
      source: Anthropic
      description: Claude is my go-to LLM. I consistently get useful content and better thinking on tough problems with Claude. I definitely vibe with Claude's tone and style, and it more consistently intuits what I'm asking for.

    - name: ChatGPT
      url: https://chat.openai.com
      type: Large Language Model
      source: OpenAI
      description: The original and most well-known LLM. Chat GPT is more multi-modal than Claude and my regualr second opionion. OpenAI adds new features to ChatGPT more quickly, but I find performance to be inconsistent. Not surprising given the size of their user base.

    - name: Gemini

      type: Large Language Model
      source: Google
      description: Google is a technical leader in AI development and Gemini is a highly-regarded multi-modal model with impressive stats. I was unimpressed by the quality of its output from earlier versions and my occasional return visits have so far not changed my perspective.

      type: Large Language Model
      source: Meta
      description: Meta's LLM is a strong, multi-modal contender, and Yann Lecun is one of the pioneers of AI. That said, Meta is at the bottom of my Tech Trust list so I try to avoid their products whenever possible. Their recent decision to end DEI practices and abandon content moderation reenforces this decision.

    - name: Grok

      type: Large Language Model
      source: x.ai
      description: This is Elon Musk's model. Elon was an early investor in OpenAI, but his unethical behavior and authoritarian attitudes make Grok an untrustworthy non-starter. Use at your own risk.
