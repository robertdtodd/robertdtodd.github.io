### About this site
I built this site to help people understand artificial intelligence. Machine intelligence is almost certainly our most consequential invention. It has the potential to help us create a better world for everyone - if we make good choices. The first step in making good choices is to understanding what's at stake, and to do that we need to rethink how we think about intelligence.


### About Me
I am a learning technology pioneer who built one of the first commercial elearning offerings (1996), one of the first SaaS learning platforms (2000), and the first global Learning Technology function at McKinsey (2008). I've invented, shaped and launched half a dozen learning platforms and over 300 learning programs and I have worked with and learned from some of the smartest learning professionals on the planet.

My ability to learn is what made all of that possible. Every person on the planet has that same ability. What's unique about me is just the unique series of experiences that I learned from. That's how I came to be me and you came to be you. 

**I love to learn**. It is the thing that drives me more than anything else. I don't know how much of my passion for learning is an accident of nature and how much of nurture, but I am grateful for it. Learning is the most important human skill. It creates intelligence, and intelligence is responsible for all of human civilization and culture. 

Learning is also how we build machine intelligence. How human and machine intelligence evolve together over the next few decades will change the story of our species.
