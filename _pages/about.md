### This Site
This site is a growing collection of content and resources for people trying to understand AI. 

Machine intelligence is humanity's most consequential invention. It has the potential to help us create a better world for everyone. To do that, we must rethink the goals we have set for technology and its role in society. This rethinking requires informed participation by more than just a few of us. To participate we must understand.


### Me
![c'est moi](../assets/images/RT-headshot-2025-small.png)

I am a learning-technology pioneer who built one of the first commercial elearning offerings (1996), one of the first SaaS learning platforms (2000), and the first global learning technology function at McKinsey & Co. (2008). I've invented, shaped and launched half a dozen learning platforms and over 300 learning programs.

My ability to learn is what made all of that possible. All of us have that same ability. It's what makes us human. What's unique about me is just the unique series of experiences I learned from. That's how I came to be me and you came to be you. 

Learning is the most consequential human skill. It creates intelligence of all kinds, and intelligence is responsible for all of human civilization and culture. 

Learning is also how we build machine intelligence. How human and machine intelligence evolve together over the next few decades will change the story of our species dramatically.
