### This Site
I built this site to help people (like me) understand AI. Machine intelligence is our most consequential invention. It has the potential to help us create a better world for everyone - **if** we make good choices. The first step in making good choices is understanding what is at stake. To do that, we need to rethink what intelligence is and what role it plays in creating the world we all live in.


### Me
![c'est moi](../assets/images/RT-headshot-2025-small.png)

I am a learning-technology pioneer who built one of the first commercial elearning offerings (1996), one of the first SaaS learning platforms (2000), and the first global learning technology function at McKinsey & Co. (2008). I've invented, shaped and launched half a dozen learning platforms and over 300 learning programs.

My ability to learn is what made all of that possible. All of us have that same ability. It's what makes us human. What's unique about me is just the unique series of experiences I learned from. That's how I came to be me and you came to be you. 

Learning is the most consequential human skill. It creates intelligence of all kinds, and intelligence is responsible for all of human civilization and culture. 

Learning is also how we build machine intelligence. How human and machine intelligence evolve together over the next few decades will change the story of our species dramatically.
